# Artificial intelligence voice assistant

## Idea behind code 
### Topic that has been chosen 
The topic that I have chosen is as follows and is directly quoted from the project instructions: 
“To build an application with voice capabilities to assist users, NLP is the preferred to understand human language. [Recognize several sentences and present the user with responses].”

### What I would like to accomplish in this project
According to the World Health Organization (BlindLook, 2021) in 2021 the amount of blind people was 39 million, and the number of people that were visually impaired was 284 million.
For this reason applications with voice capabilities to assist users is critical in being able to accommodate blind and visually impaired people when it comes to being able to use technology. 
The reason this will help visually impaired people is because they will be able to speak to get a response from the computer rather than having to type using a keyboard. 
The app I want to create will have a large button that can pressed and then once the button has been pressed the computer will listen for an input from the user and will give an answer based on preestablished answers that I have programmed the application to output depending on the sentence said or question asked. These answers will be read out loud by the computer so that the visually impaired do not need to read the output but only listen to it. 

## Techniques and models within the AI domain that will be used for my Project.
1. The application will be able to recognize the pattern of the sentence and look at the backend and decide what answer it should provide the user with (Sarker, 2022). This technique is called machine learning (Sarker, 2022). 
2. Specific sentences will be given as input so that the computer can know which answer to give depending on what is said. This means that supervised learning will occur and the type of supervised leaning technique that will be used is classification as it will be given an input and produce a sentence or label in return instead of returning a value such as a number which is used in the regression technique (Sarker, 2022). Within the classification technique there are techniques that will be used that include (Sarker, 2022): 
3. Artificial Neural Networks: this uses learning algorithms that learn and adjust as new input is received (techopedia, 2022). This will be used when input sentences are given the application can learn and check which answer to supply. 
Support vector machines: this uses classification algorithms that allows, after giving the model sets of labelled training data, to categorize new text (Campbell, et al., 2005).  These are used in the speech recognition part in the application. 
4. Natural language processing: this is a field of AI that enables machines to comprehend human language as it is spoken and written (altexsoft, 2021). Text data that is spoken is often unstructured so the following two techniques can be used to handle this text: text classification and information extraction (altexsoft, 2021).

## Ethical and legislative guidelines.
1.	My application will not infringe on the ethical guideline of not collecting information that is not consented to by the user ( CAMPBELL , 2021). The only information that will be collected will be what the user inputs themselves. 
2.	Due to me being the only one using the application I will ensure that none of the input or output sentences contain foul language.
3.	The European Union’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and POPI Act(Protection of Personal Information Act) (Michalsons, 2020) will be followed as explained above that only information the user allows to be used will be used by the application (Fernandez, 2022).
